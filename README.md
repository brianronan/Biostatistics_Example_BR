NOTE: Key parts of this project, including any real sample data and improved scoring models, may be considered protected health information and thus are NOT included in this code. Only a simplified version demonstrating the method behind this combinational approach is posted, for educational purposes.  This code is part of a larger biostatistics project focused on developing a computational method for determining the best subset of biomarkers to use as a panel for determining Condition A eczema from Condition B CTCL lymphoma . A dataset of sample biomarker concentrations is used for patients with both condition types, and a biomarker is flagged positive for Condition B if it is >2 standard deviations away from the Condition A mean concentration. Different scoring methods can be used to generate clinical sensitivity/specificity calculations on a plot for every possible biomarker combination, and the program helps identify the most promising panels for use as a clinical test.
